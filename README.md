# Archive note - A farewell to this project

JerryBot was one of my first serious coding projects. It began on September 1st, 2021 (1370 days ago) in an older repository, and continued here starting March 6th, 2022 (1184 days ago). What started small turned into just under 5000 lines of code and became one of my longest-lived projects.

I haven't worked on it in over two years, and it's time to let it go. I've learned so much from developing this — it truly marked the beginning of my coding journey. Bittersweet, but I'm proud of how far it came.

Thanks for everything, bot.

— Jerry
